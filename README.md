## 📖Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement and evaluate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models with attention mechanism. We will train the models on a synthetic dataset where the target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism in improving seq2seq model performance.

## 🧑‍💼Business Use Cases

The insights from this project can be applied in various business scenarios, including: 
- Machine translation systems 
- Text summarization tools 
- Chatbots and conversational AI 
- Speech recognition systems

## 📁Data Set Explanation

The dataset used in this project is a synthetic dataset generated for the purpose of this project. Each source sequence is a random sequence of integers, and each target sequence is the reverse of the source sequence. 

The synthetic dataset is chosen to provide a clear and simple example of the sequence-to-sequence modeling task. By reversing the source sequence to obtain the target sequence, we can easily evaluate the model's ability to learn the seq2seq mapping.

## 📊Project Evaluation Metrics

The success and effectiveness of the project will be evaluated using the following metrics: 
- **Accuracy:** The proportion of correct predictions out of the total predictions made. 
- **Loss:** The value of the loss function during training and testing.
